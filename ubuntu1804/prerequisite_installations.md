# Register for a Docker Account
- From docker.com -> get started -> Signup -> register a free account.
- Without this step, you will not be able to access the docker container used in this app.

# Install Docker Engine
- Run a series of terminal commands (the commands are listed in a separate file named "docker_engine_install_commands.md" in this folder)
- A demonstration video can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/538816164)

# Run Bash Scripts by Double Clicking (Optional)
- For convenience, it is possible to modify the settings in ubuntu to allow for executing bash scripts (i.e. container installation/uninstallation and app launch scripts) by double click as in windows 10 systems. A demonstration video can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/538831522)
